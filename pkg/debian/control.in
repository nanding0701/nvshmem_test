Description: NVSHMEM is a parallel programming interface based on OpenSHMEM
 that provides efficient and scalable communication for NVIDIA GPU
 clusters. NVSHMEM creates a global address space for data that spans
 the memory of multiple GPUs and can be accessed with fine-grained
 GPU-initiated operations, CPU-initiated operations, and operations
 on CUDAÂ® streams.
