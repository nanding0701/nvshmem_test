===============================================================================
				Changes in 2.8.0
===============================================================================

# The transport formerly called GPU Initiated Communication (GIC) has been
renamed to InfiniBand GPUDirect Async (IBGDA) to reflect the underlying
technology used by that transport.
# Improvements to the all-to-all algorithm were made for both the IBGDA and
IBRC transports. These changes specifically focused on latency bound all-to-all
operations.
# Support for RC connections was added to IBGDA to optimize workloads on small
PE sets.
# Fixed an issue in the IBGDA Transport which caused all GPUs on the same host
to use the same NIC.
# Fixed an issue in the DMA-BUF registration path. Users no longer need to
limit their allocation granularity to 4GiB when using DMABUF.

===============================================================================
				Changes in 2.7.0
===============================================================================

# Added experimental CMake build system that will replace the Makefile in a
future release
# Updated GPU Initiated Communication (GIC) transport provides significant
performance improvements over NVSHMEM 2.6.0
# Added NVSHMEM version checks to ensure that the dynamically linked NVSHMEM
host library is compatible with the statically linked device library. Also
added compatibility checks for the inbuilt bootstrap plugins.

in a job are connected via PCIe without a remote transport using the proxy
thread was fixed.


===============================================================================
				Changes in 2.6.0
===============================================================================

# Added new GPU initiated communication transport that allows kernel initiated
communication to be issued directly to the NIC and bypass the CPU proxy thread.
The transport is currently provided in experimental mode. It is disabled by default.
Please refer to installation guide for how to enable it.
# Updated the libfabric transport with initial support for Slingshot-11 networks.

				Changes in 2.5.0
===============================================================================

# Added multi-instance support in NVSHMEM. NVSHMEM now builds as two libraries,
libnvshmem_host.so and libnvshmem_device.a, making it possible for an
application to have multiple components (for example, shared libraries,
application itself) that use NVSHMEM. Support for single library, libnvshmem.a,
still exists for legacy purposes but will be eventually removed.
# Added nvshmemx_init_status API to query the initialized state of NVSHMEM
# Added experimental DevX transport that directly uses Mellanox software stack
for InfiniBand devices
# Added experimental libfabric transport that will be used to support Slingshot
networks in a future release
# Added support for CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES. Support for CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES is
not yet available with CUDA VMM and requires setting NVSHMEM_DISABLE_CUDA_VMM=1.

nvshmem-info or by setting NVSHMEM_INFO=1

===============================================================================
				Changes in 2.4.1
===============================================================================

# Added limited support for Multiple Processes per GPU (MPG) on x86 platforms.
The amount of support depends on availability of CUDA MPS. MPG support is
currently not available on P9 platforms. 
# Added a local buffer registration API that allows non-symmetric buffers to be
used as local buffers in NVSHMEM API. 
# Added support for dynamic symmetric heap allocation, which eliminates the need
to specify NVSHMEM_SYMMETRIC_SIZE. 
This feature is available with CUDA >= 11.3 and is enabled by default on x86
platforms. On P9 platforms, it is disabled by default, and can be enabled using
NVSHMEM_CUDA_DISABLE_VMM environment variable 
# Support for very large RMA messages has been added 
# NVSHMEM can now be built without ibrc support by setting NVSHMEM_IBRC_SUPPORT=0
in the environment before building.
This allows users to build and run NVSHMEM without the GDRCopy and OFED dependencies. 
# Support for calling nvshmem_init/finalize multiple times with MPI bootstrap 
# Improved testing coverage (large messages, exercising full GPU memory, and so on) 
# Improved the default PE to NIC assignment for DGX2 systems 
# Optimized channel request processing by CPU proxy thread 
# Added support for the shmem_global_exit API

for IB runs will be added in the next release.
# Improved UCX transport performance for AMO and RMA operations
# Improved performance for warp and block put/get operations
# Added atomic support for PCIe connected GPUs over the UCX transport
# UCX transport now supports non-symmetric buffers for use as local buffers
in RMA and AMO operations
# Added support for initializing NVSHMEM in CUmodule
# Enabled MPI and PMIx bootstrap modules to be compiled externally from the
NVSHMEM build. This allows multiple builds of these plugins to support various
MPI and PMIx libraries. They can be selected by setting NVSHMEM_BOOTSTRAP="plugin"
and NVSHMEM_BOOTSTRAP_PLUGIN="plugin_name.so". Plugin sources are installed along
with the compiled NVSHMEM library.
# Enabled MPI bootstrap to be used with nvshmem_init by setting
NVSHMEM_BOOTSTRAP=MPI or via the bootstrap plugin method.
# Fixed bugs in nvshmem_<typename>_g and fetch atomics implementation
